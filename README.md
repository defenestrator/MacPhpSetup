The man who was talkin' to the dog

Looked at the dog an' he said: (sort of staring in disbelief)

"You can't say that!"

He said:
- a) IT HASN'T 
- b) IT ISN'T 
- c) IT EVEN AIN'T
- d) AND IT SHOULDN'T 
- e) IT COULDN'T!
- f) they told me "NO NO NO"
- g) I told them "YES YES YES"
- f#) I said, "I DO IT ALL THE TIME"
- c#) Ain't this boogie a mess?
- g#) The poodle bites
- d#) The poodle chews it
- a#) The poodle bieeieeieieietes
- e#) The poodle chews it
- b#) Bring daddy his slippers

So I made a naive little shell script for to speed up the process of on-boarding new developers.
Run `sudo chmod +x setup_script.sh` before `./setup_script.sh`
